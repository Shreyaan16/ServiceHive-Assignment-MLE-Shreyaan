- **API Integration**: Google GenerativeAI Python SDK
- **Authentication**: API key-based authentication via environment variables

### Smart Prompting Strategy
The system implements intelligent prompting based on model confidence:

#### High Confidence Scenarios (>80%)
```
The AI model classified this image as '{predicted_class}' with {confidence}% confidence. 
Please provide a detailed description of what you see in this image, 
focusing on elements that would justify this classification.
```

#### Low Confidence Scenarios (<80%)
```
The AI model classified this image as '{predicted_class}' but with only {confidence}% confidence, 
suggesting uncertainty. Please analyze this image and provide a detailed description 
of what you actually see, which might help understand why the classification was uncertain.
```

### Integration Workflow
1. **Image Upload**: User uploads image via web interface
2. **ResNet Classification**: CNN model predicts class and confidence
3. **Conditional Prompting**: System generates context-aware prompt for Gemini
